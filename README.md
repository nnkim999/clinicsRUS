ClinicsRUs Medical Clinic aims to make booking appointments more accessible and convenient for its patients. Currently, the clinic operates on a walk-in or call-to-book basis. This project provides an online booking system prototype that allows patients to book appointments through their phone or computer, offering a more efficient and flexible booking process.

This project primarily focuses on building a vertical prototype to demonstrate the user interface (UI) and the overall user experience. It is not a fully functional application, as backend functionalities, such as database integration and full appointment management, have not been implemented. Instead, the prototype serves as a foundation for understanding how the system would look and operate in a complete implementation.
